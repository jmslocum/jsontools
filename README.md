# JSONTools
JSONTools is both a standalone command line tool for verifying, building, and printing json cleanlyi, and 
a library that can be linked against. It was developed from the stand point of having a DOM style json 
parser and message builder. When parsing a json message, the entire message is scanned and a data structure 
is built and held in memory. This data structure can then be "queried" for information you are interested in.
